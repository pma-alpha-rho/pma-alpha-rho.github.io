    <h4>Glossary</h4>
    <hr/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For someone who is unfamiliar with Greek life, there is a good deal of the language that may also be unfamiliar.  Let's try to make things a little clearer.
    <ul>
    
      <li><b>Potential:</b> A person who is either interested in the fraternity, or who someone in the fraternity may think would be interested.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Rush Week:</b> A series of events that are open to anyone who may be interested in joining Phi Mu Alpha.  Here, the potentials get to meet the brothers and vice versa in settings that promote positive social interaction.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Rushing:</b> When a potential comes to at least one rush week event, either to show interest or to learn more about the fraternity.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Bid:</b> A formal invitation from the fraternity to pledge.  Potentials are voted upon by the full chapter to receive a bid.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Bid Night:</b> The night on which bids are delivered. Potentials are asked to wait in their rooms for their bid to be hand-delivered.  The bid contains information on how to accept the bid, usually by coming to a specified spot within the same night.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Installation:</b> The official starting point of the Pledge Process, this is the official start of the pledge process.  It usually happens a day or two after bid night.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Probationary Member:</b> After a bid is accepted, the Potential becomes a Probationary Member.  They are not yet a brother, but have officially begun their journey to brotherhood.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Pledge Process:</b> Usually spanning 10 weeks, this is an introduction to the fraternity. It is designed to ensure that all of the probationary members and brothers meet at least twice, strengthen the bonds of the pledge class, and teach the Probationary Members everything about the fraternity.
      </li>

      </li>
      
      <li><b>Brother:</b> Once a probationary member completes the pledge process, he is granted the title ‘brother.’  This gives him full rights and privileges within the national organization of Phi Mu Alpha.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Chapter:</b> Refers to the body of Phi Mu Alpha at a given university and the individuals who make it up. For example, UNC hosts the Alpha Rho chapter of Phi Mu Alpha.   The chapter meets once a week, and these meetings are sometimes referred to as “Chapter.”

    <h4>History</h4>
    <hr/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alpha Rho chapter has a long and illustrious history.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Click <a href="history.php" style="color:blue">here</a> to go to our history portal.

    <h4>What We're About</h4>
    <hr/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinfonia is a Brotherhood of men bound together for mutual helpfulness.  Its purpose is not only to bring men together as friends, but also to  provide a network of brothers with whom men can commune and renew their  zeal — a support network that helps the individual to meet the  challenges that face him in his daily life. By teaching men who are  united as brothers to live their lives according to the noble virtues  set forth in the Fraternity’s Initiation Ritual, Sinfonia builds  better, stronger, broader individuals who are able to live in sympathy  and in harmony with their Fraternity brothers and their fellow man. The  Initiation Ritual of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, which will mark the  transition into full membership, is one of the most meaningful and  beautiful of the Greek tradition. The dedication to the advancement of  universal Truths and brotherly association exemplified in the Ritual  are the foundation of individual fraternal friendship, chapter unity,  and national solidarity in the promotion of Sinfonia’s dual mission:  the making of men and the uplift of mankind.
    <br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinfonians share a love of music that unites them as brothers  with a common interest. The Fraternity teaches men to develop  themselves and their art, not for the sake of art itself, but as a  means of enriching the lives of others. Through a multitude of chapter,  provincial, and national events, Sinfonia offers unlimited  opportunities for performance, community music outreach, and other  activities designed to develop a true appreciation for the power of  music to uplift the soul.<br/>
    
    <h4>Demographics</h4>
    <hr/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Brothers of the Alpha Rho chapter share a common love for music, the majority are not, in fact, music majors.  The fact that most of the Brothers are not music majors means that there is a wide range of skills available to meet the chapter's needs, as well as a diverse set of perspectives.  The chapter is comprised of majors ranging from physics to music and everything in between.  Brothers come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds as diverse as the Brothers' choices in career paths.<br/>
    
    <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
    <hr/>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student at Carolina  you have, of course, been made aware of the existence of groups of men within  the university community who bind themselves together under certain Greek  letters. Your presence here at the home of one of these groups, or  fraternities, indicates your interest in such organizations. We offer the  following definitions of what fraternity means to the men of one of these  groups at Carolina.</p>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraternity is a voluntary association of university men  bound together by ties of brotherhood into a close-knit union which works for  the mutual benefit and advancement of each member individually and the  brotherhood as a whole with no conflict between these aims. Fraternity is the  feeling of belonging to a small, highly organized group within the  often-bewildering size and complexity of a large university community.  Fraternity is watching the ballgame together, supporting each other at gigs,  parties, playing sports, banquets, work parties, cookouts, new but enduring  friendships, pledge training, workshops, big weekends, road trips, ritual,  close cooperation, pinning, conventions, and the joy of seeing mutual goals  become realities, among other things.
    <br/><br/>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraternity men pledge themselves to building within  themselves and their fraternity brothers an adherence to the highest ideals of  gentlemanly conduct. Fraternity is a unique but enduring experience…one  difficult to attain, but one that rewards throughout life the effort expended.
    <br/><br/>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is fraternity for all fraternities—so is Phi Mu Alpha a  fraternity. Yet Phi Mu Alpha is also a unique concept among fraternities at Carolina—a concept that we  feel equips us in a very special way to face the challenges which a changing  university scene is offering to the fraternity system as a whole. Phi Mu Alpha  is a fraternity with an added purpose—a purpose that goes beyond the immediate  social ends of the typical fraternity. We are a music fraternity whose members  are brought together by more than a casual interest in music.
    <br/><br/>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We build a close-knit group of university men whose mutual  interests in music are encouraged and made more vigorous by close association  with others who share these interests. Phi Mu Alpha is thus fraternity, and  Alpha Rho is Carolina fraternity, with the cooperation, parties, work, fun, and  brotherhood—yet Phi Mu Alpha chooses to direct the enthusiasm which the  experience of brotherhood builds within its members beyond itself into the  greater university community by promoting music and musical events of all types  to enrich the lives of many through the brotherhood of students of music.
    <br/><br/>
    
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those  wishing to pledge Phi Mu Alpha, we want you to know that Alpha Rho has a proud  tradition of producing great brothers. From Andy Griffith to Woody Durham (the  voice of the Tar Heels) to Cal Horton (the town manager of Chapel   Hill), Alpha Rho has always stood for the best. We, as a chapter,  do not accept second-rate effort and that is what you must live up to. But, you  will not be alone. Our chapter will stand beside you—offering everything that  we have in order to make you a more successful brother, colleague, friend, and  student. This is the essence of Alpha Rho. You have much to strive for and it  will not be easy. But, we will be there for you. Always remember, if you take  nothing away from pledging other than this: a brother is always there for you.  We sincerely wish you the best and look forward to one day calling you a  brother of Phi Mu Alpha, Alpha Rho.
