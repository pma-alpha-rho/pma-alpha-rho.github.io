    <h3>About Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</h3>
    <img src="images/PhiMuAlphaSinfoniaCrest.gif" class="fltrt" 
alt="Fraternity Shield" />
    <p>Sinfonia is a Brotherhood of men bound together for mutual helpfulness.  Its purpose is not only to bring men together as friends, but also to  provide a network of brothers with whom men can commune and renew their  zeal — a support network that helps the individual to meet the  challenges that face him in his daily life. By teaching men who are  united as brothers to live their lives according to the noble virtues  set forth in the Fraternity’s Initiation Ritual, Sinfonia builds  better, stronger, broader individuals who are able to live in sympathy  and in harmony with their Fraternity brothers and their fellow man. The  Initiation Ritual of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, which will mark the  transition into full membership, is one of the most meaningful and  beautiful of the Greek tradition. The dedication to the advancement of  universal Truths and brotherly association exemplified in the Ritual  are the foundation of individual fraternal friendship, chapter unity,  and national solidarity in the promotion of Sinfonia’s dual mission:  the making of men and the uplift of mankind. <br />
      <br />
      Sinfonians share a love of music that unites them as brothers  with a common interest. The Fraternity teaches men to develop  themselves and their art, not for the sake of art itself, but as a  means of enriching the lives of others. Through a multitude of chapter,  provincial, and national events, Sinfonia offers unlimited  opportunities for performance, community music outreach, and other  activities designed to develop a true appreciation for the power of  music to uplift the soul. <br />
