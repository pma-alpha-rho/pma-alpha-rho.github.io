<![CDATA[<h1>What is a Sonecast venue?</h1>
<p>A Sonecast Venue is basically a content aggregator plus a social network. It brings together podcasts, photos from Flickr, videos from YouTube 
(and other video services), and blog posts. Think of a Venue as an instant social media mash-up tool.</p>
<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
<p>It's simple. Upload your photos and videos to Flickr and YouTube and assign them tags.  To have your content appear here use the tag "pmaap" and 
whatever others you like.  Then, create a Sonecast account and beside each photo, video, or blog post, find the "discuss" icon.  Click and start 
having conversations about your media.</p>]]> </description></item></channel></rss>
