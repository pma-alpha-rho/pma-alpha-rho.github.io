<p>A Sonecast Venue is basically a content aggregator plus a social network. It brings together podcasts, photos 
from Flickr, videos from YouTube (and other video services), and blog posts. Think of a Venue as an instant 
social media mash-up tool.</p>
<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
<p>It's simple. Upload your photos and videos to Flickr and YouTube and assign them tags.  To have your content 
appear here use the tag "pmaap" and whatever others you like.  Then, create a Sonecast account and beside each 
photo, video, or blog post, find the "discuss" icon.  Click and start having conversations about your media.</p></description></item></channel></rss>
